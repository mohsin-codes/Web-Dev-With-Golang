# Web Dev with Golang

This is a repo where I put my practice files while learning Web Dev with Golang

I am following the course : 
> Web Development w/ Google’s Go (golang) Programming Language by Todd Mcleod

>Review: This course is one of the best course for learning about the basics of web dev using Golang. Definitely GO for it.

If you would like to improve my work. I am definitely up for it. Thanks! 🙌🙏
